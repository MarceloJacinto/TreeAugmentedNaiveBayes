# TreeAugmentedNaiveBayes
An implementation of a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes classifier. 

This classifier was build as part of a project for the UC of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) at Instituto Superior Técnico, ULisboa.

In this project, the goal was to develop a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes classifier in java. This classifier receives 2 csv files, one for training and another for testing.

## Table of contents:
- Java source code
- UML of the project
- A small report giving an overlook of the entire project
- Project.jar (developed with java 13.0.2)
- Javadoc, accessible at this link: https://marcelojacinto.github.io/TreeAugmentedNaiveBayes/
- A test file for example

## Usage:
```
java -jar Project.jar <train.csv> <test.csv> LL c
```
LL - Log-likelihood score
MDL - Minimum description length score
c - show confusion matrix
